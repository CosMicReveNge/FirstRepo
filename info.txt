First you create a folder and initialise with git ( type git init)

Now git knows about the folder and the files in it but they are not yet committed (untracked files)

Then use the add command to get the file into the staging environment(ready to be committed)
(Use git add --all if more than one file to be added)

Now, the file is ready to be committed (git commit -m "message")
